General
    - TODO: need to rationalise the css classes - reduce any duplication, and misnomers
    - the tool doesn't account for a pre-existing inventory
    - cockpit -> flask. On older versions of flask, the cockpit.http calls receive a RST (reset) packet from flask, so calls to the API fail. When this
    happens the UI stops working due to the js error. flask versions found to work flask >= 1.0.2, flask_restful 0.3.6
    - ceph-ansible provides .sample named playbooks that need to be copied/renamed before use
      - this should be done by the plugin post-install script
    - docker pull timeout shows this error
      ceph-3 failed in role 'ceph-container-common', task 'pulling docker.io/ceph/daemon:latest image'. Error msg - non-zero return code
      WORKAROUND: all.yml now written with 600s timeout (default is 300s)

hostspage.jsx
    - Once collocation rules are applied, and the inventory created, the user could go back to the environment page and
      select a different cluster type, which would not match with the new collocation rules. If the user selects a different cluster or install
      type, the inventory should probably be wiped and they should start again from scratch
    - if you get ssh auth issues, the modal dialog presents the path to the prod mode ansible-runner-service file - even when the daemon is actually
      running in dev mode
    - BUG: using a mask that has 0 prefixed numbers doesn't work. The first number in the series is correct, but subsequent numbers drop the '0'.
      
validatepage.jsx
    - None

deployPage.jsx
    - if metrics are deployed any network delay pulling grafana hits an ansible timeout for the playbook. Ansible doesn't close cleanly, so 
      the UI hits an Oops!
    - if the metrics host runs out of memory (too low to start with!), the ansible task fails in the UI but no information explaining the error
      is shown

networkpage.jsx
    NIC bandwidth is reported as unknown, when ansible returns a speed of 0.
        this happens on some interfaces; docker bridge, libvirt bridge or when the target machine is a VM using virtio based NIC

ansibleMap.js
    - allVars() : for rgw use case there are a number of settings that would be beneficial, but adding them
      requires changes to the jinja2 template for ceph.conf first

ceph_check_role
    - ansible module doesn't check the spec of the metrics host. If the metrics host = ansible host it is possible for the host to run
      out of memory, and the cockpit UI will not receive a reason
